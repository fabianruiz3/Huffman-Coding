# Huffman-Coding
This project focuses on implementing Huffman Coding, an encoding algorithm that uses variable-length codes to compress data. 
The goal is to encode a message using shorter codes for more frequently occurring symbols, thus reducing the overall space required for storage.
It was developed as part of a Programming Assignment for the Data Structures Course (CIIC4020) at UPRM.

## Constructing Huffman Code

Calculate the frequency distribution of symbols in the message.
Identify the two symbols with the lowest frequency.
Assign a differentiating bit to each of these symbols.
Combine the two symbols into a new symbol with a combined frequency.
Repeat steps 2-4 until only one symbol remains.
Represent the process using a Huffman Tree.
